I'll talk about the logistics, what I came across and the best strategies to get your requests filled in a timely manner.""",b'60'
b'Literally Everything The New York Times Knows About Elections',b'Proposed by: Jeremy Bowers',"b'At roughly 400 words per minute, I will tell you everything The New York Times has learned about elections, including why you can\'t use ""democrat"" to look up the democratic party in Minnesota to why you shouldn\'t store delegates as an integer. BONUS: Did you know the US got a new county in 2015? It probably broke your map!'",b'56'
"b""Stuff I've said to FOIA officers to get them to give me ... well, stuff""",b'Proposed by: Cezary Podkul',"b""It's ok to get angry, get sassy or creative in the pursuit of lowering FOI fees or getting documents or data that you're told you can't have. In this lightning talk, I'll share some of my more creative exchanges with FOIA officers that have gotten results.""",b'53'
b'Self-care for Nerds',b'Proposed by: Aditi Bhandari',"b""Most of us spend 8-12 hours on our computers every day.

b'How to collaborate when no one understands what you do',b'Proposed by: Caelainn Barr',"b""Calling all weirdos! Are you the strange numbers reporter, the pretty chart-maker, or the person in the corner who gets excited when your code runs? One of the challenges of working with data and code in the newsroom is getting across what it is you actually do. I'll show you how aggressive collaboration has helped us work better with other editors, reporters and designers in our newsroom.""",b'47'
b'CAR through the ages -- what I learned from collecting every single NICAR program since 1990',b'Proposed by: Christine Zhang',"b'I used to think that ""data journalism"" started in the 2000\'s. Then I dug further into the history of computer assisted reporting (CAR). News nerds have been congregating at this conference since the early 90\'s. Let me take you on a tour of the recent history of CAR, as seen through NICAR conference programs. Like"" CAR Rock 1994"" in Cleveland, where Jennifer LaFleur showed off her maps of San Francisco\'s single men -- overlaid with income data and complete with interviews of some wealthy bachelors themselves. From ""Internet 101"" to ""FoxPro versus Paradox"" to ""Regress for Success"" -- I\'ll show you what\'s changed and what hasn\'t over the years, with fun/embarrassing pictures of some NICAR veterans to boot (like this one from 1994 http://www.drewsullivan.com/staff.html, when the NICAR staff dressed up like the cast of ""Happy Days"").'",b'45'
"b""58 stupid things we learned from mapping all 25,000 of California's election precincts""",b'Proposed by: Joe Fox',"b""We made the most detailed map of California election results ever, which meant harassing all 58 counties and dealing with 58 different ways of reporting election results. We'll condense two months of tears, gin and PDFs into 5 minutes.""",b'38'
"b""Using Uber's open data to understand cities""",b'Proposed by: Cory Kendrick',"b""What is this new open dataset Uber has released? And why should I care? Turns out you can use traffic travel times to understand cities better. Such as: what happens to travel times when there's a metro shutdown? Or when you add bike lanes? Or when it rains? I'll walk you through what exactly Uber Movement data is \xe2\x80\x93 and isn't \xe2\x80\x93 and how to dive in and start using it.""",b'34'
b'Data out loud: Building charts that blind users can read',b'Proposed by: Leslie Shapiro',"b'Journalists increasingly rely on charts to simplify complex data for readers. But in our noble quest to demystify data, we sometimes make it much harder for people with vision impairments to read. This talk will go over 5 quick and painless (really!) things we can do to make charts more accessible to people who use screen readers.'",b'33'
b'I can draw my charts with no libraries...just SVG...just SVG.',b'Proposed by: Divya',"b'As data journalists, we use libraries like D3 to create beautiful and compelling visualizations for the web.

b'What I learned by downloading satellite photos of every power plant in the US',b'Proposed by: Marc DaCosta',b'The production of electricity in the United States accounts for approximately 5% of global CO2 emissions. That\xe2\x80\x99s a really big and quite abstract order of magnitude. And it begs the question: how can something so gargantuan be re-scaled to a more human perspective? In this talk I will cover helpful tips for finding data on critical infrastructure and offer novel approaches to visualizing it.',b'19'
b'43',b'Proposed by: Rachel shorey',"b""There's lots of divisive stuff in the world. You know what can't be divided*? Prime Numbers.Five minutes. Forty-Three facts about prime numbers. That's just about 7 seconds per factoid. Facts will range from the cryptographic to the mathematic to the musical to the silly.*Except by one and themselves""",b'18'

"b""Grief's geography""",b'Proposed by: Patrick Cain',"b""Maps and interactives can show the world as it is now, or reconstruct a forgotten past on a familiar landscape. I'll go through how I turned a dusty card file from the 1940s into an interactive map showing Toronto's 2,800 Second World War dead on their next of kin's homes. (There were some challenges along the way.)""",b'16'
b'What Rocket Science Can Teach Us About Designing for Humans',b'Proposed by: Justin Myers',"b""NICAR-L and news-nerd Twitter is fantastic, but in 5 minutes, I'll show you what NASA can teach us when it comes to how people process information and interact with tech. Hear about how putting people in space has resulted in great advice for the newsrooms of Earth, such as pointing out missing data, labeling things clearly, and handling the regret of pushing the wrong button.""",b'15'

Twitter reports that since 2014 alone, over 110 billion emojis have been tweeted. Yet, despite the profusion of emojis in digital life, little research has been done that leverages emojis to understand popular sentiment around current issues. I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about how emoji data science, a largely unexplored field, might be a powerful new methodology for both the computational social sciences as well as fast data journalism.I\xe2\x80\x99ll share preliminary research based on an analysis of millions of tweets that explores the relevance of emoji analytics to fields ranging from pop culture (i.e. the Kanye West vs. Taylor Swift dispute), to politics (the US presidential elections as well as Brexit), to gender norms, to the Olympics, and more.'",b'10'

b'Draw any type of timeline with a single web-based tool',b'Proposed by: Matthew Brehmer',"b""A timeline graphic is a great way to tell a story, but it can be difficult or tedious to make and customize timelines using popular charting tools. In this talk, I'll introduce Timeline Storyteller (timelinestoryteller.com), an expressive web-based timeline authoring tool released by Microsoft Research in January 2017. Using this tool, you can create a wide range of timelines, with each design emphasizing a different aspect of the underlying data. You can also selectively annotate the timeline and export it using one of several image formats. Timeline Storyteller was inspired by a survey of existing timeline authoring tools and over 200 bespoke timelines, consolidating a diverse design space within a single application.""",b'4'

b'Data-driven chart annotation with ChartAccent',b'Proposed by: Matthew Brehmer',"b""Adding annotations to a chart such as text, shapes, and highlights can draw the viewer's attention and convey key messages. However, the process of annotating a chart is tedious, imprecise, and often independent of chart creation, meaning that the annotations are unaware of the underlying data. I'll introduce ChartAccent (https://chartaccent.github.io/), a web-based tool that combines chart creation and data-driven annotation, developed in collaboration between visualization researchers at UC Santa Barbara, Pennsylvania State, and Microsoft Research. Inspired by a large corpus of annotated news graphics and tools like the NYT's Mr. Chartmaker, ChartAccent supports an extensive range of annotation forms and styles for commonly used chart types.""",b'3'
