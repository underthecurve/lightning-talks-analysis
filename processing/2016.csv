"b""Let's Talk About the Future of Interactive News Content""",b'Proposed by: Gregor Aisch',"b'For more than a decade news apps and graphics developers loved using the word ""interactive"" to describe all kinds of new things they put on the internet. But what does ""interactive"" even mean? Slideshows, tooltips and d3.js? Have we reached the peak of the golden age of ""interactives"", or has it just started? Let\'s take five minutes to look at where we are and where we\'re going...'",b'68'
"b""Let lookup save you from the boring, repetitive work you've forgotten you're even doing""",b'Proposed by: Chris Groskopf',"b""Admit it: you've copy and pasted a column of state names next to one of USPS codes... hundreds of times.

In this lightning talk I will introduce a tool and a project. The tool works. The project needs you. Together, we can forever vanquish the drudgery of the lookup table. Fans of csvkit or agate: please allow me to  introduce you to `lookup`.""",b'60'
b'Regular Regular Expression Exercises for Regular People',b'Proposed by: Dan Nguyen',"b""So you're not cut out to be one of those highfalutin programming databasers who can brag about their automated cloud bots bragging about their other automated cloud bots. But even if you're just a regular person with regular data needs, you can still learn and practice regular expressions to find and filter the kinds of things you already know you want to know from a pile of documents -- dates, names, money amounts -- and anything else that's a combination of the regular old alphabet and numbers 1 through 10.""",b'47'
"b'I Improved My Math Fluency, And So Can You'",b'Proposed by: Ryann Grochowski Jones',"b""In high school, math felt like a foreign language to me -- difficult to understand, stressful to learn and, above all, something to avoid. Now, not only is math a big part of my job, but it's enjoyable as well.

b'Solve Every Statistics Problem with One Weird Trick',b'Proposed by: Jonathan Stray',"b'DON\'T OPEN THAT TEXTBOOK. Statistics is a cycle of abuse and I\'m here to make it stop. In five minutes I\'ll show you the refreshing new approach that everyone\'s talking about: randomization and visualization. Learn what types of problems statistics really solves and how to solve them with just a few lines of common sensel code. Get the right answer faster than you can say ""Monte Carlo"" and never memorize a formula again!'",b'38'
"b""Don't crAMP our style!""",b'Proposed by: Rich Harris',"b""Google's AMP project will make the mobile web faster. It will also strike a death blow to innovation in digital journalism. Learn why it's so dangerous \xe2\x80\x93 and what we can do to prevent the AMPocalypse.""",b'37'
b'How $200 and open source software can help you track the flights of globe-trotting billionaire playboys',b'Proposed by: David Yanfosky',"b'We tracked helicopters at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland (http://qz.com/600590/) using a Raspberry Pi, a $20 USB stick, and some wire most typically found connected to your cable box.

b'Interaction considered harmful',b'Proposed by: John Muyskens',"b'Bret Victor, in his essay ""Magic Ink,"" argues that interactivity in software interfaces is a ""curse."" He argues that interaction, for the user of information software, is a liability that should be minimized, extending Tufte\'s ideas about data visualization to software design. What can we as designers and developers of ""interactives,"" ""news apps"" and software journalism tools learn from Victor\'s ideas about information and interface design?'",b'30'
b'Ding! Finding new ways to level up new data journalists',b'Proposed by: Thomas Wilburn',"b'There\'s a big gap between ""student journalist"" and ""hardened newsroom coder,"" and existing solutions for bridging that gap (such as workshops and internships) don\'t seem to have eased the difficulty that many newsrooms have with finding talent. Certainly academia does not appear to be adequately addressing the need for skills. Can we create a solution for training outside of those systems, to create more experienced (and more diverse) journalists? This talk covers my experiences after posting a call for remote mentees to the NICAR-L list, and looks at other approaches taken from open-source software and other industries that might help.'",b'29'

And in the days following: what did I learn about journalism \xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93 as I went from a person covering the news, to someone living through it?""",b'28'
b'Turning Investigations Into Radio or: What I Learned Moving From Print to the Pig Farm',b'Proposed by: Peggy Lowe',"b'How can stories with lots of numbers, looonng explanations and dozens of interviews become compelling audio stories? How can I translate a one-year investigation into a four\xe2\x80\x93minute piece? And more importantly, how can the print peeps who used to do that work at newspapers make the transition to radio and podcasting? Peggy Lowe, investigations editor at Harvest Public Media and KCUR, gives her top tips on moving from ink to air.'",b'27'
b'The Dark Side of Regression: P-hacking with R',b'Proposed by: Andrew Flowers',"b'Did you now that eating egg rolls was linked to dog ownership? And potato chips to a higher SAT maths core? Well...not really. These relationships *are* statistically significant; but they were found by ""p-hacking"" data from nutrition studies.

b'How to Tell Data Stories on Social',b'Proposed by: Gurman Bhatia',"b'So many platforms, so little time. Do I use GIFs or create something in After Effects? Just take a screenshot of that chart or use the latest social media meme-making tool? The dirty secret about telling data stories on social is that you need to treat each platform in its own unique way and tailor the story accordingly. In this talk, I will present examples of data stories told in innovative ways on different social media platforms. By the end, you will walk away with ideas and simple tricks to bring back to your newsroom.'",b'25'

Also learn about GNU Parallel, which can speed up any repetitive command-line task.'",b'24'
b'The shocking secret to successfully negotiating for data: Be nice.',b'Proposed by: Chad Skelton',"b'Like many reporters, I used to spend a lot of time on my blog and Twitter criticizing government agencies for refusing to release data or taking too long to do so. Then, a couple years ago, I tried something different: Praising the few agencies that actually cooperated with my data requests. A case study in why carrots are as important as sticks in getting access to data.'",b'24'
b'Who run the world? Hybrid journalists!',b'Proposed by: Anne Li',"b'Leaving business decisions to ""the business people"" is no longer a luxury traditional and computer-assisted journalists can afford.

In the talk, she'll detail the often depressing reasons why, as well as what working journalists can do to change them.""",b'21'
b'Daily Keyboard Exercises For Reducing Wrist Strain and Making Stronger Computational Brain',b'Proposed by: Dan Nguyen',"b""Programming and data analysis are already difficult enough without you diverting your brain energy to memorizing variable/function names or even just keeping focused as you switch between multiple applications. Learning a few keyboard shortcuts -- which can be used whether you're working or playing -- can free your brain for the more thoughtful part of computational work, and maybe even reduce risk of carpal tunnel syndrome from mouse/trackpad overuse.""",b'19'
"b""You\xe2\x80\x99re doing it wrong: the do\xe2\x80\x99s and don'ts of social media from Tumblr teens and Snapchat queens""",b'Proposed by: Nicole Zhu',"b""Social media and partner platforms are increasingly important for news and media organizations, but building up a presence is so much more than just calling the youngest person into the room and asking them to explain Snapchat. We\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss the do\xe2\x80\x99s and don\xe2\x80\x99ts for the most popular social media platforms, ranging from Mic's great Tumblr presence to the success of Vox\xe2\x80\x99s Snapchat Discover, with tips and tricks from (gasp) youths.""",b'18'

"b'How America killed African journalism. Thanks, America!'",b'Proposed by: Chris Roper',"b'Ok, not really. But it is true that American tech companies are eating/have eaten the revenue base away from under the shaky structures of traditional African news media. Which means the death of democracy. Which means you\xe2\x80\x99re eating your own children. Ick. So I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to fix that. Or at least, how we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to go down fighting. In five slides. Maybe four.'",b'17'
"b""(\\d ) things U.S. NICARians don't have to (know|worry about)""",b'Proposed by: Isao Matsunami',"b""Dozens of non U.S. reporters attended NICAR last year and brought a lot of precious know-hows back home.Some techniques are ready-to-use (yes, I used them), but some are not applicable in their country due to custom, language, geometry, law, social taboo, FOIA(lack of it), state of open gov...I (we, hopefully) will show you several things that U.S. NICARians don't have to worry about but that foreign NICARians are tackling (there might be inverse cases), which might inspire something in U.S. data journalists.I want this to be a kind of collective presentation and needs collaborative inputs from international journalists/foreign correspondents if accepted.""",b'16'
b'Why Nobody Understands Mass Incarceration (And The Problems Your Stories Might Have)',b'Proposed by: Paul Levande',"b'""Mass Incarceration"" has been a big news story for a long time, but unfortunately no one (myself included) really understands it.

b'Data and Fires in Indonesia',b'Proposed by: Nithin Coca',"b""Last year, the most horrific fires in human history broke out in Indonesia, the consequences of years of deforestation and negligence. What began shortly thereafter, and continues to this day, is a battle of accusation, with hard to access, often conflicting data - maps, concessions, GHG emissions, and health statistics - at the center. I'll explain how I, as a journalist, told stories about this muddled field and reflect on how to use data in places where the data is, often, the story itself.""",b'3'
