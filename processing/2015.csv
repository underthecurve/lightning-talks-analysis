"b'The end of maps, in 7 charts'",b'Proposed by: Darla Cameron',b'Got geographic data? A cartographer shares seven reasons why you should visualize it with something other than a map.',b'104'
"b'Decision, decisions! Lessons for deeply-interactive storytelling'",b'Proposed by: Nadja Popovich',"b'What if we asked more from our readers, rather than less? In this talk, I\xe2\x80\x99ll present examples of interactive projects that force readers to make meaningful decisions. These interactives demand more time and attention from readers, but reward them with a deeper, more visceral understanding of the topic at hand.'",b'71'
b'What do blind people see? A thought-talk about our obsession with visuals and how it translates for the blind',b'Proposed by: Suyeon Son',"b""They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Tweets do better when there are images attached. Gifs have developed their own culture. In a world where we strive for more visually-compelling stories, how are those elements relayed to the blind? In this talk, I will muse about how we could make visual-centric stories accessible to those that can't directly interpret pixels on a screen.""",b'65'
b'Beautiful Satellite Images in 5 Minutes',b'Proposed by: Jeff Larson',"b""Give me 5 minutes and I'll show you how to make cloudless beautiful satellite images of (almost) anywhere in the world. And I'll open source some code on stage to boot.""",b'61'

b'5 data visualizations - each in 5 lines or less of R code',b'Proposed by: Sharon Machlis',"b'Afraid to make the leap from Excel to coding because you think it\'s ""too hard""? Thanks to some incredibly useful add-on packages, you can generate everything from maps to stats plots to interactive JavaScript graphics in just a few lines of R code. See why you shouldn\'t fear the command line!'",b'60'
b'Seven awesome features you will want in your next charting tool',b'Proposed by: Gregor Aisch',"b'In this session we will take a quick look at some features of ""Chartmaker"", the internal charting tool we pretty much build from scratch at the New York Times, and that now is the backbone for our data-driven journalism at TheUpshot.'",b'58'
b'Wrestling with data (without coding)',b'Proposed by: MaryJo Webster',"b'Pretty much every dataset I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met has had some problem that required me to do a little wrestling with it before I could analyze it. Standardizing names. Splitting addresses. Pulling it out of a PDF. Or simply getting it out of a \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d structure. These days there are lots of tools you can use. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little old-school and find myself working on one-off projects where writing a script seems unnecessary. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to show you 10 of my go-to tools and tricks that I use over and over and over again, ranging from really easy to moderately complicated. If words like SQL, Python and Perl send chills down your spine, then these are definitely must-have\xe2\x80\x99s for your toolbox, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a data newbie or have 30 years under your belt.'",b'58'
"b'The Five Stages of Terrible Data: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance'",b'Proposed by: Steven Rich',"b""Your data isn't perfect. It never is. I'll tell you how you can (accurately) use data with holes and when to just throw it out and try something new.""",b'55'
"b""Stop trying to multitask. You're terrible at it.""",b'Proposed by: Chris Canipe',"b'When we split time, we lose time. We lose it writing and answering emails, dropping in and out of projects and remembering what function does what and which variables are stored where. When our brains are tired, we slip up. We make bad design choices, write sloppy code and forget edits. Science has a name for this mess: decision fatigue. We can only keep track of so many ideas and make so many decisions before we lose our edge. This talk will describe research on our feeble brains and present simple solutions for concentrating when it counts.'",b'53'
b'Stop letting the ~cool~ factor detract from your journalism',b'Proposed by: Ashlyn Still',"b'The Internet of 2015 is way cool and filled with snazzy things. Parallax scrolling! HTML audio and video! Animated everything! As digitally-minded journalists, our brains are constantly churning with new ways to use the innovative web technologies we see in the wild as alternative story forms. But at what point does the \xe2\x80\x9ccool\xe2\x80\x9d factor start to detract from the value of the story you\xe2\x80\x99re telling? This talk will explore the balance between expository and extravagant, looking at examples where fanciful delivery enhanced the story  \xe2\x80\x93 as well as instances where it didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 and how to use the slickest, newfangled technology to your advantage.'",b'51'
b'How to read 52 books in 52 weeks',b'Proposed by: Nicole Zhu',"b""Nothing's better than curling up with a good book. I'll talk about (1) why you should set the daunting goal of reading a book a week for a year, and (2) how you can achieve it.""",b'49'
b'Risk Ratios in R in 4 Minutes',b'Proposed by: Ryann Grochowski Jones',"b""Risk ratios are used by epidemiologists to describe the risk of getting a disease relative to exposure, but journalists can use them to calculate the risk of any occurrence. Just one line of R code will give you a risk ratio complete with a confidence interval. It's so easy, I guarantee to finish the talk in four minutes, leaving one minute to share dog photos submitted by the NICAR community.""",b'46'
b'YOU GOT THIS: The agony and ecstasy of data journalism. And cats.',b'Proposed by: David Eads',"b'So many people in our community are doing great work with little thanks and a lot of stress. Let\'s toast your hard work with affirmations like ""You got this! The social media strategy was just about perfect!"" and ""You got this! The audio doesn\'t work with in-app browsers, but it works everywhere else!"" along with photos of NICARians\' cats. Send your ideas for affirmations and photos of your cat(s) to @eads.'",b'46'
b'How I beat the trolls and got on with my life while they cried alone in their basement',b'Proposed by: David Yanofsky',"b""Let me walk you through how to avoid pain and anguish when all of a sudden your inbox explodes and your phone won't stop ringing. With real life experiences like death threats! fake craigslist ads! and lawsuit intimidation!""",b'44'
b'Sketchy Data: When Comics and Data Journalism\xe2\x80\x99s Powers Combine',b'Proposed by: Jordan Wirfs-Brock',"b'No photo? No graphics? No problem. Sketches can be powerful tools for communicating data. And chances are, you\xe2\x80\x99re already a cartoonist and you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know it. In this talk, I\xe2\x80\x99ll share the lessons I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from drawing time-lapse buckets of brine and bell curves that look like actual bells, plus three easy ways you, too, can use doodles to make data come alive for your audience \xe2\x80\x93 whether you draw like da Vinci or a third-grader. (Just think about what xkcd accomplishes with stick figures!)'",b'44'
b'Saving Journalism With Web Components',b'Proposed by: Alex Duner',"b""Imagine a reporter writing just one line of HTML to embed maps and charts with your publication's custom styles and interactions. Web Components are a cutting edge browser technology that let you bundle markup and styles into custom HTML elements. They might also be a great way to empower reporters to tell better stories on the web without them needing to code. We'll talk about what's great about Web Components, some pitfalls, and some ideas for using them in journalism. We'll descend into the depths of the Shadow DOM and, if we're lucky, make it out alive.""",b'44'
b'Correlation = Causation: A Completely Sarcastic Introduction to Intermediate and Advanced Statistics',b'Proposed by: Steven Rich',b'Five minutes on what not to do when performing statistical analyses.',b'42'
"b""Let's step outside""",b'Proposed by: Erika Owens',"b""A lot of journalism is about understanding things from perspectives other than your own. I'll discuss some tactics for how to step outside of your own experience and bring that consideration to designing welcoming events and experiences.""",b'42'
"b'Good web performance is a feature, too!'",b'Proposed by: Ryan Murphy',"b""Good design is not just about how an interactive or news app looks and functions \xe2\x80\x93 its also about respecting our users' time and experiences with our products. This talk will touch on easy (and not so easy) ways to optimize the delivery of content and on how to optimize performance once it has arrived. We'll also go over strategies to ensure performance remains a priority at all stages of development. Respected users are happy users!""",b'41'
b'Things I learned from Spock',b'Proposed by: Brian Boyer',b'WARNING: Talk may contain colorful metaphors.',b'37'
"b""Roland Barthes Doesn't Care What You Think \xe2\x80\x94 To Story or Not in Data Visualization""",b'Proposed by: Emily Withrow',"b'Roland Barthes: French, dead, thought many important thoughts. Inspired by some of the recent anti-storytelling-in-data-viz backlash, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about *intention* in storytelling: who\xe2\x80\x99s involved, how and when a story is formed, and how much control we ultimately have. This talk will use some of Barthes\xe2\x80\x99 essays as a framework\xe2\x80\x94in a super accessible way, I swear\xe2\x80\x94to explore what we mean when we talk about story in graphic form, and to what extent it matters for data visualization.'",b'37'
"b""Using beauty for good not evil - data vis do's and dont's""",b'Proposed by: sschnadt',"b'Beautiful data vis can be glib, distracting, confusing, fascinating, powerful, and crazy informative. I will explore why, and go over strategies for using aesthetics to optimize the impact of telling stories with data.'",b'35'
"b""How to code like a coder when you're not""",b'Proposed by: Chris Schnaars',"b""Hey, even Chase Davis and Jeremy Bowers had to start somewhere. Are your programming skills closer to print('Hello world!') than data domination? Do you think ; and , are just punctuation marks? Is Python really better than Rails? (Yes.) To become a coding bad ass, you need to THINK like one. Incidentally, I'm not, but if you pick my lightning talk, I'm going to discuss it anyway.""",b'34'
b'Making Twitter bots for news (and fun)',b'Proposed by: Joe Fox',"b""Twitter bots can be fun (@wikisext), weird (@FFD8FFDB), boring (@evryshadeofgray), informative (@Aurora_Alerts), silly (@burritopatents), sillier (@IndictBot), ridiculous (@butt_things) and even beautiful (@Lowpolybot), awe-inspiring (@andromedabot) and thought-provoking (@SnowballPoetry). But can they be helpful for news? Let's explore the world of Twitter bots and find out.""",b'33'
b'The web is for everyone',b'Proposed by: Ryan Murphy',"b""According to the World Health Organization, more than 285 million people are estimated to be visually impaired worldwide. But web accessibility isn't just about optimizing for screen readers \xe2\x80\x93 it's about ensuring our content is usable by a wide range of people, including individuals with motor and auditory impairments. In this talk I'll go over common accessibility myths, provide basic tips and discuss ways to test your content. I'll also introduce the A11Y Project[1] and provide information on how you can get involved![1] http://a11yproject.com/""",b'32'
b'Doing better by international colleagues.',b'Proposed by: Jeff Kelly Lowenstein',"b'Many journalists working outside of the United States face serious obstacles including extreme physical danger and low levels of Internet access and tech resources.  Although there has been a lot of collaboration with those colleagues, we can do more.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about concrete steps to do just that.'",b'30'
b'Evangelical Python',b'Proposed by: Daniel Lathrop',"b""Jon McClure and I will explain how the Gospel according to Guido is helping us transform our newsroom into a data-y-er place.

b'Ride Wit Me: Channeling Nelly in Student Newsrooms',b'Proposed by: Nicole Zhu',"b""If you wanna go and take a ride wit me // We makin apps in the newsroom with the D3 // Oh why do I code this way? (Hey, must be the learning!)---Think police ride alongs, but with fewer stakeouts and donuts and more coding and donut charts. Using a student news organization at Northwestern University as an example, I'll talk about how code ride alongs have helped get more students programming and more writers involved in interactive storytelling.""",b'28'
b'Long live flat files',b'Proposed by: Chris Wilson',"b""With some creative techniques, you can make even multi-gigabyte datasets searchable using only flat files. Why would you do this to yourself? Because it's massively easier and long-lived than dealing with databases and servers. This is an expansion on this Source post: https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/case-flat-files-big-data-projects/""",b'27'
b'Being an X in a sea of Ys and why nots',b'Proposed by: Dana Amihere',"b""One of the most debated issues I've seen to date on the NICAR listserv has been that of single-sex coding education aimed at women and minorities.  As a development community, how do we navigate these issues of gender and race, and why should we care at all? Let's take a look at how we can be sensitive to these differences without compromising the caliber of training everyone has access to. Other types of communities have been successful in doing this; what can we learn from them going forward?""",b'26'
"b""Pat Stith's Rules""",b'Proposed by: J Andrew Curliss',"b""If NICAR had a Mount Rushmore, Pat Stith would be on it. When he retired from the News & Observer of Raleigh, he bequeathed to us his rules. 10 of them. They apply to your work -- coding, conducting showdown interviews, creating data visualizations, assembling multi-part projects. They're rules for life. With Stith's permission, I'll share them with you.""",b'24'

Gather 'round for a fun-filled, exciting adventure on how to examine whether minor flooding is increasing in your hood. Included: Quick exciting, arousing overview of tidal datums, likely appearances by a rapper or two and a couple ideas to take back to your editors now.""",b'23'
b'How to measure your programming knowledge in units of xkcd',b'Proposed by: Suyeon Son',"b""xkcd, in its footer, has a disclaimer: 'this comic occasionally contains strong language (which may be unsuitable for children), unusual humor (which may be unsuitable for adults), and advanced mathematics (which may be unsuitable for liberal-arts majors).' I, a young'n (read: #millennial)/part-time adult majoring in journalism, took this as a challenge. The result is a *highly scientific* method of calculating my knowledge of programming, in units of xkcd comics.""",b'21'
b'Preplication -- The right way to confront story subjects in a data-driven story',b'Proposed by: Bill Alpert',"b'How should you confront the subjects of a data-driven story with your data and analysis?  I describe the practices I\'ve developed to share an open-source replication bundle that allows them to confidentially reproduce, examine and critique your analysis and findings.  It\'s enabled me to find errors and focus my questions _before_ publication.  The practice also sets you up to provide reproducibility materials to your readers _after_ publication.  Over time, I\'ll post ""preplication"" templates in R, Python and other languages that journalists can adapt as they see fit.  I\'ll be giving one of the R classes at Nicar 2015 on this topic, but I want to also reach folks unable or uninterested in listening to me blather for 45 minutes. bill alpert, barron\'s'",b'20'

b'Picking locks',b'Proposed by: Chris Schnaars',"b""So you've got two tables of cool stuff you want to marry into one really great dataset. The problem: you don't have a key to pull this wedding off. Rather than reach for the shotgun, why not just craft your own key?""",b'15'
b'Kill your CMS: How not to end up like Ozymandias',b'Proposed by: Chris Wilson',"b'Bit rot is a huge problem for news apps as companies constantly upend their CMS, migrate servers, and otherwise mess up the delicate process whereby projects get publish. Our solution at Time is to work entirely outside any CMS or internal platform, and to open-source as much as possible for posterity. I seek to free all people from the chains of content-management systems.'",b'12'
"b'To make people pay attention to you, wear all black'",b'Proposed by: Suyeon Son',"b'I\xe2\x80\x99m just kidding. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a catch-all strategy.  In this talk, I will relay my lessons as a lowly intern/student type rebranding herself in one of the only communities where professionalism doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to trump personality. Think: Twitter handles.  Your pet projects. Your favorite color to wear. The personalized emojis of you in your Slack/Hipchat channels.'",b'12'
b'Learn to love your CMS',b'Proposed by: Joe Fox',"b""We can choose our friends, but we (usually) can't choose our CMS. But that doesn't mean you can't still do cool things within its confines!""",b'12'
b'Geotag your interviews',b'Proposed by: Jue Yang',"b""Stories on maps are not new, but when collecting interviews where geography plays in a big role, quickly seeing them on a map will help shape the story. What's even better, these interview data points can be used to create rich interactive stories later on. I'll show you how to use geojson.io to geotag your interviews and prototype you story -- in three simple steps.""",b'11'
b'Unicorn-Centered Design',b'Proposed by: Tara Adiseshan',"b'We continue to build tools that are driven by data that is machine-learned and dynamically generated, taking us further and further away from the more constrained static datasets of the past. When leveraging unicorn data, or data that might contain unknowns even to the developers, it becomes increasingly difficult to design interfaces that enable coherent user experiences. I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about designing interfaces that forgive, take advantage of, and overcome the challenges of unicorn data.'",b'11'
b'Time-lapse videos of the Umbrella Revolution or coding on your iPad on vacation with your parents in Japan',b'Proposed by: Cedric Sam',"b'When tear gas was fired on protesters in Hong Kong on September, prompting the Umbrella Revolution, I was on a plane with my parents to Japan. With only an iPad 3 and an archive of traffic webcam snapshot images (at every minute) that we happened to have, I contributed time-lapse videos stitched together on the command-line (ffmpeg, ftw!).  It provided some interesting insights and unconventional points of view, e.g. this one a few hours after the first tear gas shots: http://multimedia.scmp.com/occupylapse/'",b'10'
b'Communicating across the technology border',b'Proposed by: Alexandra Kanik',"b""When you're a tech person, talking to people who don't deal with code and databases all day can be difficult, especially when those people are your superiors.

b'Love it or leave it',b'Proposed by: sara1985',"b""Doing something you really want and feel passion about it, it gives your strength that you don't know you have it. When hard times come you'll think about giving up, but there's something inside yourself that tells you DON'T STOP! only you can stop you!
