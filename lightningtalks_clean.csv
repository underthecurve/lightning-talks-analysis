2018,News Counts: A National Journalism Network to Cover the 2020 Census,Mark Hansen,0,NA,Columbia University Journalism School,1,"New York, NY",0,"On April first, in years that end in zero, we participate in a unique national moment. We exercise our constitutional right to be counted in the Decennial Census, a count that influences the structure of our political system, and dictates how $600 billion in federal funds are allocated to local cities and towns. But the Census needs our help. In 2020, it is a high wire act -- our first ""online"" count, it is sorely underfunded, behind schedule, and dealing with late demands from the DOJ and others. All of this could warp the count, in disheartening yet predictable ways. We are building a National Journalism Network to help cover the 2020 Census. We are forging new connections between local newsrooms and local statistical, computational and demographic expertise to tell stories of the importance of the Census, and to help fend off the inevitable challenges attempting to discredit the count. Join us! A bad Census could bankrupt data journalism for a decade.",29,0,0
